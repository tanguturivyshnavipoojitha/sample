I used GitHub Copilot to assist with generating Python scripts for this repository. Copilot suggested code for [briefly describe the functionality, e.g., data processing, file parsing, etc.]. Specifically, it helped generate functions for:

[List the main functions or scripts Copilot generated, e.g., data cleaning, API calls, etc.]
[You can mention a specific file or section if needed]
Did you modify the script? If so, why?
Yes, I made some modifications to the code generated by Copilot:

Reason for modification 1: [e.g., "The original suggestion did not handle edge cases, so I added input validation."]
Reason for modification 2: [e.g., "I optimized the loop for better performance."]
[Describe any other changes you made]
How did you test it?
I tested the script by:

Running the script with sample data and checking the output for correctness.
Creating unit tests to verify the functionality of each function.
[Any other testing approach, e.g., manual testing, integration test, etc.]
